Hi everyone! I’m glad to welcome you on my account. My fullname is Anton Okhrimenko. At the time of writing this bio I am 19 years old. I don’t have any experience in programming, so I decided to start learning C++. Maybe it's a little late but as they say "And that from the age at which a person begin their journey, no matter how old it is, you can try. So?". I will publish my projects and probably some ideas or concepts, so that other people can improve them. If you have any ideas or suggestions you can write to me on email or other social networks.

P.s Over time will add something new about my adventures
